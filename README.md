### Drone-Delivered Nalaxone System 

We	are	in	an	opioid	crisis	killing	more	than	63,000	Americans	a	year.	An	opioid	over-dose kills	by	causing	
the	victim	to	stop	breathing	and,	within	2-5	minutes,	if	not	reversed	by	a	naloxone	antidote,	the	heart	
stops	 beating	 resulting	 in	 death. It	 is	 often	 not	 physically	 possible	 (especially	 in	 suburban	 and	 rural	
areas),	 nor	 cost-effectively	 feasible,	 to	 get	 Emergency	 Medical	 Services	 (EMS)	 first	 responders	 to	 the	
scene	 to	 administer	 the	 antidote	 quickly	 enough	 to	 save	 most	 victims	 once	 they	 stop	 breathing. The	
potential	use	of	drones	 to	get	a	life-saving	naloxone	antidote to	a	layperson	at	 the	scene	of	an opioid	
over-dose is	the	new	frontier	in	emergency	care.

### GAIA 

The user must keep their environment alive by continuously moving throughout the worlds via Kinect. Only one person can explore the environments at a time. We decided to use the Kinect because we want to foster a community around the issues of climate change, and so we did not want the user experience to be isolated or solitary. The best exhibition format for this environment is projection because this is way more than one person can experience the virtual world at the same time. While there is one active user, we envisioned that the group watching will also be complicit in the game, similar to how we are all complicit in taking care of the earth. 

Only works with Microsoft Kinect.

### The Hole 

Enjoy exploring the village and the various objects inhabiting it. Outside the gates is the forest leading up to the hole. You have free reign to explore as you wish, but in order to progress the game you must follow the instructions of the hole. There are seven days, each day having a different set of objects that the hole demands. You must pick up these objects and feed them to the hole. Upon doing so, the next day will begin.

To be used with Oculus Rift.
