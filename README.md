### Drone-Delivered Nalaxone System 

The objective of this project was to construct a system to field test the concept of delivering life saving medical devices, mainly the opioid overdose reversal medication Narcan​R ​(naloxone HCl), to a bystander in the City of Richmond. Richmond is 62 square miles with a mean radius of 4 miles. After a 911 call is made in Richmond, an ambulance dispatched from Richmond Ambulance Authority (RAA) will take on average 6 minutes to arrive on scene. Our Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) could arrive on scene anywhere in the city in under 2 minutes. Those minutes are crucial to survival since for every 1 minute after the heart stops life expectancy is reduced by 10%.

### GAIA 

The user must keep their environment alive by continuously moving throughout the worlds via Kinect. Only one person can explore the environments at a time. We decided to use the Kinect because we want to foster a community around the issues of climate change, and so we did not want the user experience to be isolated or solitary. The best exhibition format for this environment is projection because this is way more than one person can experience the virtual world at the same time. While there is one active user, we envisioned that the group watching will also be complicit in the game, similar to how we are all complicit in taking care of the earth. 

Only works with Microsoft Kinect.

### The Hole 

Enjoy exploring the village and the various objects inhabiting it. Outside the gates is the forest leading up to the hole. You have free reign to explore as you wish, but in order to progress the game you must follow the instructions of the hole. There are seven days, each day having a different set of objects that the hole demands. You must pick up these objects and feed them to the hole. Upon doing so, the next day will begin.

To be used with Oculus Rift.
